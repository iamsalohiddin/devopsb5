# Problem 3: We are given 3 sides of a triangle.
# Triangle is equillateral when all sides are the same.
# So, in this code we have to display True when triangle is equillateral and 
# False otherwise

a=9
b=9
c=10

equillateral = a==b==c
print(equillateral)

# the calculation above is possible because  python supports chained comparison
# operator.
