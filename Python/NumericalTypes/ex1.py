# In the farm we have 35 cows , 23 chickens,
#and 40 ducks.
# Create a program to calculate total number of 
# legs in the farm
#Requirements create a variable for 
# cows, chickens and ducks , and create variables
#for their number of legs. 
# print "We have 'result' legs in the farm"

leg_number_of_cows = 35*4
leg_number_of_chicken = 23*2

#NOTE: Python is going to add space when comma is used in print fumction. 
# Comma is used for separating texts and numbers in print function.
